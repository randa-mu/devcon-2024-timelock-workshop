# üè¶ DeFi Safety Workshop: Timelock Encryption üõ°Ô∏è


Welcome to the **DeFi Safety Workshop: Timelock Encryption**! This repository contains all the resources, code, and materials needed for a hands-on developer workshop focused on improving security in decentralized finance (DeFi) using timelock encryption. [Timelock](https://randa.mu/features/timelock-encryption-on-chain) encryption enables data to be encrypted and decrypted only after a specified time period or condition is met. This approach is valuable for delaying access to sensitive information, securing transactions, and mitigating front-running attacks.

## About the Workshop

In this workshop, we explore how the security of smart contracts and DeFi applications can be enhanced using **timelock encryption**.

Participants will:
- Learn the fundamentals of timelock encryption and its applications in DeFi. It is worth mentioning that this differs from [Timelock smart contracts](https://www.lcx.com/introduction-to-timelock-smart-contracts/), also known as time-based or delayed contracts, which are a specialized type of smart contract that introduces a delay or time-based constraint on the execution of certain actions or transactions.
- Understand the potential vulnerabilities that timelock encryption addresses to enhance the security of DeFi protocols.
- Implement a simple smart contract that incorporates timelock functionalities.

## Workshop Agenda

1. **Introduction to Timelock Encryption**
    - An introduction to timelock encryption:
        - What is it?
        - Features
        - Use cases
2. **Enhancing Security in DeFi with Timelock Encryption**
    - Overview of use cases in DeFi (e.g., securing auctions, sealed bids, delayed transactions, securing governance actions relating to lending parameters, securing staking reward distribution information, among others).
3. **Hands-On Exercise: Simple Auction Smart Contract with Sealed Bids Secured by Timelock Encryption**
4. **Q&A and Wrap-Up**

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:
- Understand the principles and benefits of timelock encryption in DeFi.
- Implement and deploy Solidity smart contracts with timelock functionality.
